            <p className="products-para">Tata Structura Yst 210 steel tubes possess a yield strength of over 210 MPa and
                ultimate tensile strength of over 330 MPa, along with a high elongation of over 20%. The cross sections
                of Tata Structuraâ€™s circular, square, and rectangular hollow steel sections have superior geometric
                properties, providing it excellent structural quality amongst the commonly available construction
                products in the market.</p>
            <p className="products-para">The combined advantage of high-quality steel tubes with consistent yield strength
                and superior geometric properties helps save over 25% of material wastage and is economical when
                compared to open sections like angles and channels etc. The surface of Tata Structura steel tubes is
                also ideal to achieve a smooth surface finish that provides a superior look and feel for the end
